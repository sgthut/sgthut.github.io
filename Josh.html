		<p>		Josh is someone that I met on the later end of freshman year but was set to be living with our friends sophomore year. During sophomore year we became pretty close with Josh and it was decided that he was going to live on the upstairs level with the other three of us. Josh loves to stay active and either bikes or goes for a run just about everyday. He is an early riser and lives to get a head start on the day, usually being done with breakfast and onto homework or class by the time I wake up. He is easily the most driven towards schoolwork on our floor as it seems like he is doing homework or studying for exams 24/7. When we are lucky enough to snag a small bit of his freetime outside of club soccer season, we tend to play a lot of video games or watch a sporthing event. Josh loves to hunt and fish when he can just like Ryan and me so it makes for a lot of fun times during breaks and on the weekends. Josh is currently completeing his BBA in Real Estate and is set to start graduate school in the fall for Real Estate on the prive equity track.</p>
