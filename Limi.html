		<h2>About Limi</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Age: 22</li>
			<li>Hometown: Ripon, WI</li>

		</ul>
		<p>		Limi is from the same hometown as Ryan and they have been going to school together since the 6th grade which is when Limi moved to Ripon from Alaska. His family came to the United States from Albania and has been running resturaunts ever since. They currently own Ripon Family Resturaunt which we visit every time we go to town. I even stop over to visit with my family while we are at the lake. I think it is really funny because I had been going there for years before I had ever known Limi and I didn't meet him until freshman year of college here in Madison. Here now, Limi loves working out, music, and diving into different TV series but, I think what he loves most is sitting his butt in a hammock somewhere in a tree and relaxing. It is something we do every chance we can once it starts to get warm out. Currently, Limi is studying personal finance and after graduating this semester will help take over his dad's resturaunt. He plans to stay involved in personal finance somehow as it is something that he really enjoys but ultimately wants to open up a resturaunt of his own one day. </p>
