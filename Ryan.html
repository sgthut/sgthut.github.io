		<p>		Ryan Brewer is from Ripon, WI and currently lives in the largest bedroom at the front of our house. His room is about twice the size of most of the other ones just because of the layout of the house and even comes with a private balcony (although he does share it with the rest of us). In high school, Ryan ran cross country and played basketball, both of which he still does just non-competitively. Ryan spends most of his time playing video games, working out, or binge-watching shows and movies although is very driven in completing his school work. After graduaiton, Ryan plans to move back home near Ripon and take over their family business, Brewer Heathing and Cooling Inc.. We have been good friends since we met freshman year and figured out that their hometown is one town over from the lake in which my family has a cottage on. I am sure this friendship will carry on after college especially since I plan on moving somewhere closer to Ripon after graduation so that I can be closer to the lake.</p>
